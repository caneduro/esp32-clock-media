Tiny Wi-Fi Clock / Media Display
A compact 3D-printed desk gadget that displays the time or, with a press of the on-board BOOT button, switches to show your PC’s current media activity (received via Wi-Fi from a small Python script).
The enclosure is printed in three PLA parts (front, middle, back) assembled with heat inserts and screws for a solid, serviceable build.
It prints in about 1 hour and uses only ~13 g of PLA — perfect for a quick and satisfying build.
Features
    • 🕒 Clean, high-contrast oled time display
    • 🎵 Media mode with track info and progress
    • 📡 Wi-Fi6 communication with a simple Python script on your PC
    • 🔘 Uses the on-board BOOT button — no external switch needed 
    • 🧱 3-part enclosure with heat inserts + M2 screws
    • ⚡ USB type C connection 
Print Details
    • 🧵 Material: PLA (~13 g)
    • ⏱ Print time: ~1 hour
    • 🧩 Included 3MF parts: front (screen cover), middle (electronics housing), rear

How to Flash the Code to the ESP32-C6 SuperMini
Follow these steps to upload the firmware to your ESP32-C6 using the Arduino IDE.
🔧 1. Install the required tools
    1. Download and install the Arduino IDE (version 2.x recommended).
    2. Open the IDE, go to File → Preferences.
    3. In Additional Boards Manager URLs, add this URL (if not already present):
          https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json 
    1. Go to Tools → Board → Boards Manager and search for:
“ESP32 by Espressif Systems”
→ Install it (or update to the latest version).
    2. Install any required libraries for your project (e.g. WiFi, SSD1306 display, etc., depending on your code, they are usually on top).
🔌 2. Connect the ESP32-C6 to your PC
    • Plug the board into your computer using a USB-C cable (ensure it’s a data cable, not charge-only).
    • The board should appear as a COM/serial port or it should be recognized as ESP32 Family Device then select the appropriate device.
🧭 3. Select the correct board
In Arduino IDE:
    • Go to Tools → Board → ESP32
    • Select “ESP32C6 Dev Module” (or “ESP32-C6 SuperMini” if shown).
🔌 4. Select the right serial port
    • Go to Tools → Port
    • Choose the port labeled ESP32C6 or the newly appeared COM port.
If you’re unsure which one is correct:
    • Unplug the board → check the list
    • Plug it back → choose the new entry that appears.
📄 5. Load your project code
    • Open the .ino file (or create a new sketch and paste your code).
    • Go to Sketch and click Add file… to add the fonts (THIS IS MANDATORY)
      
    • Verify that any required libraries are installed otherwise it will give out error (the error shows wich library is missing).
📝 6. Adjust upload settings 
Usually the defaults work, but for ESP32-C6 ensure:
    • Tools → Upload Speed: 115200 (safe default)
    • Tools → USB CDC On Boot: Enabled
    • 
    • Tools → Partition Scheme: Minimal SPIFFS (otherwise ota update will not work)
⬇️ 7. Put the board into bootloader mode (if required)
Often the ESP32-C6 enters bootloader mode automatically.
If flashing fails on the first attempt:
    1. Hold BOOT
    2. Click RESET (if present on your module)
    3. Release BOOT after 1–2 seconds
Then try uploading again.
Most C6 SuperMini boards auto-reset and you won’t need this step.
🚀 8. Upload the code
    • Click the Upload button (the right-arrow icon).
    • Wait for compilation and flashing to complete.
    • The serial monitor will confirm a successful upload.
✔️ 9. Test the device
    • Open Serial Monitor (Tools → Serial Monitor) to check Wi-Fi logs or debug messages.
    • If using your BOOT button to toggle modes, verify it responds correctly once the device is running.,
